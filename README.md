# Tic-Tac-Toye-Game
Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid, where players take turns marking the spaces with "X" and "O". The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If the grid is filled without any winner, the game results in a draw.
